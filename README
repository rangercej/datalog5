DataLog - 1996 C. Johnson
=========================

Written for a TA-880 multimonitor, it logs to disk the inputs of various 
sensors (strain gauges, thermocouples, etc). Targetting Borland Turbo C
v2 under DOS, so this is really more of historic interest if nothing else.

I vaugely remember using a DOS program called "TheDraw" to design mimics so
things could be shown real-time, but beyond that I don't recall much more!

Given it's so old this code, I'm releasing into the public domain.

As for the TA-880 itself, there's very little information online. Best I can
find is this from ebay (no, this is not my listing ... but it's the only
info google searches are finding, and thought it would be useful context):

------------------------------------------------------------
Listing is for a C.I.L Electronics TA800 Multimonitor. I can find very little
about this online, though I also own a almost identical TA880 unit that was
re-branded and housed in a industrial enclosure by Tinsley, who deny all
knowledge of its existence when questioned about it.

What this does is provide 11 channels of input and 3 channels of output. The
input can be a thermocouple or other micro-volt source, or across a strain
gauge. It has cal curves for most types of thermocouple. The 3 outputs can be
set to output voltages and two of them can also simulate a thermcouple, which
is quite novel. Their main use though would be to provide excitation for the
strain gauges.

I have never fully figured out how to use this, but pressing a channel, then
either mV or a thermocouple type gives a reading if its an input or then
entering a value and hitting "W" produces it as an output (iirc). A manual for
this would be very useful. It is fairly accurate, as per the photos. You can
also scroll the output up and down live with the arrow buttons. 

Here is an extract from "Strain" magazine in 1983 for the almost identical
TA880 (note the price!):
* The Multi-monitor TA880 is designed to provide multipurpose monitoring of
  volts, thermocouples, strain gauges and output simulation of thermocouples and
  millivolts. 
* The front panel is specially designed with membrane switches for easy operation
  and programming. It also includes a four and a half digit display and various
  indications. Eleven input channels and three output channels are available
  together with isothermal input conditioning, auto-range and zero,
  auto-linearisation and strain calibrations and autorecalibration. Price £850.

Sold as seen in the photos, not fully tested and exercised (and quite old).
